	<h1>My opinion on a mission statement for the hierarchical learning opportunities presented in the field today.</h1>
	<p>Emergency management is a worldwide phenomenon. A young one at that. One that needs to bee nurtured to fruition. Emergency management has a tremendous opportunity to grow right now. The field was only started in the eighties. The old wizards who started the field, harboring the most experience are still in it. New influxes of students through programs throughout the globe have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn off of these wizards. The opportunity is like speaking to the man who invernted the telescope as an astronomer. The founders created and developed the tools to sense the diamonds, and they're still out there leading the charge to mine them. Let us, as the new new lead the charge with them.</p>
