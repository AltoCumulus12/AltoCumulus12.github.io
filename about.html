        <p>Hi my name is Billy. I love the weather. I love learning about it and talking about it, but mostly talking about it. I also like computers and computer science. I find most facinating the future applications of the subjects like quantum computing and AI. I have a Bachelors of Science in Meteorology and a minor in Computer Science. A goal I have of mine is to expand upon my education in these subjects, applying myself to higher capacities of learning about them. Fun fact, I used AI to write a template for this webpage.</p>
