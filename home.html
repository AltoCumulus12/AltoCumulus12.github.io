    <h1>This is my simple website consisting of two pages. One is a homepage and one is a 5-day forecast page. Feel free to check back for updates and additions in the future. Thank you for visiting.</h1><!--Maybe not call it a forum if they are weather articles where you cant comment on posts and such-->

    <!--Maybe do a front page with recent articles on the weather and climate. This would require some daily or weekly reading on weather articles. Maybe read 1 daily and decide weather to post it to the website or not. Maybe based on how relevant it is or not to the time.-->
